          I am an aspiring fullstack developer currently studying at the University of Richmond. I am a past graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor's degree in English. I have spent most of my life in public service; serving my local communities as a Paramedic for over a decade, and as a former soldier in the US Army.

          I take a lot of creative inspiration from my outdoor hobbies. When I am not in front of my computer I can either be found on a backroad somewhere in the mountains exploring new sights, or on my kayak floating down the river watching birds and taking in the views of untouched nature.
